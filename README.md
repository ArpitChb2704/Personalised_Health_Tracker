# Personalised_Health_Tracker

The Personalised Health Tracker is a web-based application designed to predict a user's risk of diabetes based on personal health parameters. Built with Graido for the backend and deployed using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces, this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for health risk assessment using machine learning models.
This is a very Basic model based on Linear Regression and the Dataset I have used for this is taken from Kaggle.
This is a basic and intoduxtory Project the result and the model may be unfit , but will surely make good projects ahead.

## Features

### Input Parameters: Users can provide details such as:

Number of pregnancies
Glucose level
Blood pressure
Insulin level
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Age

### Risk Prediction: The app predicts the risk level (e.g., High Risk, Low Risk) for diabetes based on the input data.

### Probability Output: Displays the probability score for the predicted risk.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: Gradio interface
Machine Learning: scikit-learn model
Deployment: Hugging Face Spaces
